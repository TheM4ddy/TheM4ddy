# Hello World!🌎

Hi! You can call me _Bethy_ or Maddz, _Bethy_ being my real name and the other my online name :P
I'm a computer science student in IF (Instituto Federal de São Paulo).
I love coding and I'm trying to make a hobby out of it, I suck at math but I try my best to overcome the difficulties I have, as they say
**_"It's not about the end goal, it's about the path."_**

# 🎯 Goals:

I want to be a game maker, software developer and maybe a Database manager, I also want to get good at programming logic and math but currently I'm just learning the basics of database and how to make a game.
